## Overview  
The goal of this assignment was to practice using Apache Spark for distributed data processing and analysis. I practiced basic data manipulation on a small DataFrame in Googleâ€™s cloud Colab Notebook service.

## Instructions to Run Code  
1. Open this Google Collaboratory file: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v2oFrkddt7KO8oL2YM6lIN94_-3w5NrN?usp=sharing)  
2. Click the **Run** button next to each section of code to execute the cells.
